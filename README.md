Real-Time Color Sensing Robot using Webcam in MATLAB
Prerequisites:
1.MATLAB (Ensure you have the Image Processing Toolbox installed.)
2.Webcam Support: MATLAB supports webcam integration via the webcam function.
Overview:
This code captures live images from the webcam, identifies a specific target color (in this example, red), and responds based on the color intensity detected in real time. The target color can be changed by modifying the RGB values.
